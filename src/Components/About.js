           <h2>Hello, I'm Mandeepkaur!</h2>
           <p>I'm an inquisitive person who likes to learn lots of different things, a problem-solver who challenges everything, and a diligent worker who doesn't take life too seriously and celebrates the simple things.</p>
           <p>I had been working in the business industry for almost four years but desired a change. I learned to code in high school but had no idea I could make a career out of it. So I changed gears and entered the technical profession, and I am currently prepared to welcome the opportunities that will come my way. </p>
           <p>I am passionate and solutions-driven full stack web developer with a Web Development Certificate from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I'm delighted I finally decided to take the plunge. Now I'm seeking for my first professional position as a Software Engineer, as well as a team with which to interact and learn.</p>
